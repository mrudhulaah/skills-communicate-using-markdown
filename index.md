# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Why Use Markdown?

Markdown is popular because it is easy to learn and use. It can be created using any text editor and is compatible with many applications.

### Basic Syntax

Here are some common Markdown syntax elements:
- **Bold text**: `**bold**`
- *Italic text*: `*italic*`
- `Code`: `` `code` ``
- [Links](https://example.com): `[Link](https://example.com)`

#### Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists:
- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2

##### Images

To add an image, use the following syntax:
![Alt text] (https://example.com/image.jpg)

###### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are very simple to create:
> This is a blockquote.
